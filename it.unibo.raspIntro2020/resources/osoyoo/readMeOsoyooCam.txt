ROBOTCAR 

picar camera

In this lesson, we will learn how to let the robot car has vision to see front environment and how 
to control the robot car through web browser or mobile APP.

To complete this task, we need install a web server software called “mjpg-streamer” in Raspberry Pi,
this software will catch video from Robot Car camera and send the video to a web page.

We also need to install another web server software called “WebIOPi” in Raspberry Pi. 
This software will allow user to use browser to remotely control Raspberry Pi GPIO input/output and
therefore control the movement of our robot motor.

Python 3.5.3

/home/pi/superscript
Your webiopi and web stream server will start and your can use browser or APP to control the car now!
