<h1>Basic Robot with step</h1>

<div class="body"> 
<h2>Introduction</h2>
We are giong to build a software <em>system</em> with a role of interface between a user and a robot. The system will be able satisfy all the requirements 
and let the robot do the requested thing. The requirements wil be analyzed and then formalized in order to have clear <k>what</k> the <em>system</em> has to do.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<div class="req">
    Design and build a software system (<em>basicrobot</em>) that is able to receive via Internet commands (represented 
    in textual form), so that: 
    <ul>
        <li>the commands <k>w | s | h | a | d</k> move a <i>differential drive robot</i> (<em>robot</em>)  respectively
        <k>forward | backward | stop | left | right</k>  (<ks>req-cmd</ks>).  </li>
        <li>the command <k>step</k>  moves the <em>robot</em> forward for a prefixed time (e.g. <tt>2</tt> secs) (<ks>req-step</ks>).</li>
    </ul>
    Moreover, the <em>robot</em> must be always able to react 'immediately' to the <k>stop</k> command, by stopping 
    any ongoing movement (<ks>req-stop</ks>).
</div>

Analysing this requirements the <em>system</em> will take the name of <em>basicrobot</em>, in fact we can assume that the <em>basicrobot</em> is the <em>system</em>. 
From now we will speak about the <em>system</em> using the name <em>basicrobot</em>.

<h3>Premise</h3>

We note that:
<ul>
    <li>
        the system logically includes two components: the <em>robot</em> and another external component (let us name it <em>caller</em>) 
        that sends commands to the robot via Internet;
    </li>
    <li>
        there is no specification about the <em>caller</em>. Thus, we will assume that it will 'adapt' to the interaction rules established by the <em>robot</em>. 
        However, we cannot assume that the <em>caller</em> will be coded in the same language used to build the software running on the <em>robot</em>; 
    </li>
    <li>
        there is no specification about the <em>robot</em>. We will assumme here that the customer will provide a proper <k>API</k> 
        to use some virtual or real robot.
    </li>
</ul>
Since we are going to write software for a <b>distributed, heterogeneous</b> system, the <i>conceptual space</i> of 'classical' object-oriented
programming is not the best staring point to talk about the system. Rather, we could use an agent-based or an actor-based
<i>conceptual space</i>, in which the interaction among components occurs only by means of messages represented as Strings. 
<br/><br/>
In the following, we will use the custom 
<a href="http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/anatali/iss2020Lab/blob/master/it.unibo.qakintro2020/userDocs/LabQakIntro2020.html" target="web">
qak metamodel</a> as our (starting) language to denote models of the system at the variuos stages of our development process.

<h2>Requirement analysis</h2>

The key-point here is to understand well and to fix the logical way in which the robot accepts the commands. 
<br/><br/>

Since, at these stage,  we aim at capturing <k>what</k> the system has to do,
we must be - in absence of specific requirements -  totally <b>technology-independent</b> 
(i.e. we cannot make reference to any concrete technological support for communications on the Internet).
<br/>
Thus, we consider appropriate to 'think' about the system by adopting the <ks>conceptual space</ks> of the
<a href="http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/anatali/iss2020Lab/blob/master/it.unibo.qakintro2020/userDocs/LabQakIntro2020.html" target="web">
qak metamodel</a>, in which the components of a software system are 'actors' able to exchange information as messages of three different (main) types:

<ul>
    <li>dispatch</li>
    <li>request</li>
    <li>event</li>
</ul>

<kc>After a discussion with the customer</kc>, we can define the logical architecture of the system as follows: 
<br/><br/>
<a href="../src/basicrobot.qak">basicrobotreq.qak</a>

<h3>Notes</h3>
In this model:
<ul>
<li>the <em>basicrobot</em> works as a sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices" target ="web">Microservice</a>
on the TCP-port <tt>8018</tt>, exploiting the <tt>qak-infrastructure</tt>. 
This is useful for fast prototyping; however, the final infrastructural support has to be defined later, by the project designer;
</li>
<li>each state is associated with a specific, named requirement. This is very useful for <kc>requirement traceability</kc>;</li>
<li>we exploit the 
<a href="http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/anatali/iss2020Lab/blob/master/it.unibo.robot2020/userDocs/LabVirtualRobot.html" target="code">
Virtual Robot</a> available in our company, in order to show a working (<k>mock</k>) prototype to the customer;</li>
<li>we leave the <k>doStep</k> state still under-specified, since the <ks>req-step</ks> seems 'more demanding' than the <ks>req-cmd</ks>.</li>
</ul>

 

<h2>Problem analysis</h2>

<h3>The requirement  <ks>req-cmd</k></h3>
From the <i>functional</i> point of view, the <em>basicrobot</em> is a <k>translator</k> of commands expressed in the user-language 
(<tt>w | s | h | a | d</tt>) into commands expressed in the language of the concrete <em>robot</em> to be used. 
<br/><br/>
During the execution of a command expressed in the <i>user-language</i>, the  <em>basicrobot</em>  
could hit an <k>obstacle</k> (either fixed or moving). Since no specification is given in the requirements about this problematic,
at the moment we assume <k>absence of obtacles</k>.
<br/><br/>
Moreover, we can assume that the robot is moving on a flat 
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space" target="web">euclidean</a>) space.
<br/><br/>
Under these assumptions, we can use the model defined in the requirement-analysis phase as it is.

<h3>The requirement  <ks>req-step</k></h3>
The <ks>req-step</ks> entails the 'problematic' to define a <kc>proactive</kc> behavior (for a given time), without loosing the 
capability to be <kc>reactive</kc> to the <k>stop</k> command according to the <ks>req-stop</ks>.
<br/><br/>
The 'problematic' to define a <kc>proactive</kc> behavior for a given time implies the need to 'react' to an event sent by
a timer. The

<h3>The requirement  <ks>req-stop</ks></h3>
    The <ks>req-stop</ks> implicitely bring the <em>basicrobot</em> to assume a <kc>reactive</kc> behaviour. The <ks>req-stop</ks> 
    implies that the system must be responsive to the <k>stop</k> command. The stop command received is the same that could be received during a step, 
    in fact, as required, when a stop command is received the <em>robot</em> as to stop regardless of the state in which it is.
