<h2>Requirements</h2>
<div class="req">
    Design and build a software system (<em>steprobot</em>) that is able to receive via Internet commands (represented 
    in textual form), so that: 
    <ul>
        <li>the command <k>step</k>  moves the <em>robot</em> forward for a prefixed time (e.g. <tt>2</tt> secs) (<ks>req-step</ks>).</li>
    </ul>
    Moreover, the <em>robot</em> must be always able to react 'immediately' to the <k>stop</k> command, by stopping 
    any ongoing movement (<ks>req-stop</ks>).
</div>

<h3>Premise</h3>

We note that:
<ul>
    <li>
        the system logically includes an external component (let us name it <em>basicrobot</em>) that we will use as an interface to send 
        commands via Internet;
    </li>
    <li>
        the system does not interact directly with the <em>robot</em> but it use the <em>basicrobot</em> to perform this interaction, the basic <em>basicrobot</em> 
        has established some interaction rules, provided as API, that allow to send it the commands <k>w | s | h | a | d</k> which meaning respectively 
        <k>forward | backward | stop | left | right</k>.
    </li>
</ul>
Since we are going to write software for a <b>distributed, heterogeneous</b> system, the <i>conceptual space</i> of 'classical' object-oriented
programming is not the best staring point to talk about the system. Rather, we could use an agent-based or an actor-based
<i>conceptual space</i>, in which the interaction among components occurs only by means of messages represented as Strings. 
<br/><br/>
In the following, we will use the custom 
<a href="http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/anatali/iss2020Lab/blob/master/it.unibo.qakintro2020/userDocs/LabQakIntro2020.html" target="web">
qak metamodel</a> as our (starting) language to denote models of the system at the variuos stages of our development process.

                    }

                The key-point here is to understand well and to fix the logical way in which the robot accepts the commands.
                <br/><br/>
                
                Since, at these stage,  we aim at capturing <k>what</k> the system has to do,
                we must be - in absence of specific requirements -  totally <b>technology-independent</b> 
                (i.e. we cannot make reference to any concrete technological support for communications on the Internet).
                <br/>
                Thus, we consider appropriate to 'think' about the system by adopting the <ks>conceptual space</ks> of the
                <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/anatali/iss2020Lab/blob/master/it.unibo.qakintro2020/userDocs/LabQakIntro2020.html" target="web">
                qak metamodel</a>, in which the components of a software system are 'actors' able to exchange information as messages of three different (main) types:
                
                <ul>
                    <li>dispatch</li>
                    <li>request</li>
                    <li>event</li>
                </ul>
                
                <kc>After a discussion with the customer</kc>, we can define the logical architecture of the system as shown to the left.

<h3>Notes</h3>
In this model:
<ul>
<li>the <em>steprobot</em> works as a sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices" target ="web">Microservice</a>
on the TCP-port <tt>8016</tt>, exploiting the <tt>qak-infrastructure</tt>.
This is useful for fast prototyping; however, the final infrastructural support has to be defined later, by the project designer;
</li>
<li>each state is associated with a specific, named requirement. This is very useful for <kc>requirement traceability</kc>;</li>
</ul>

<h2>Problem analysis</h2>

<h3>The requirement  <ks>req-step</ks></h3>
The <ks>req-step</ks> entails the 'problematic' to define a <kc>proactive</kc> behavior (for a given time), without loosing the 
capability to be <kc>reactive</kc> to the <k>stop</k> command according to the <ks>req-stop</ks>.
<br/><br/>
The 'problematic' to define a <kc>proactive</kc> behavior for a given time implies the need to 'react' to an event sent by
a timer. The 
<a href="http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/anatali/iss2020Lab/blob/master/it.unibo.qakintro2020/userDocs/LabQakIntro2020.html#whenTime" target="web">
whenTime</a> primitive gives us the required expressive power:

<table>

            <m>A model 'wired' on  <tt>2-second</tt>  specification:</m>
            <pre>

                State doStep{
                    forward <em>basicrobot</em> -m cmd : cmd( w )
                }
                Transition t0 
                    <k>whenTime</k>   2000 -> endStep		//<ks>req-step</ks>

        <td>
            <m>A model in which the step time is set by the caller:</m>

<h3>The requirement  <ks>req-stop</ks></h3>
    The <ks>req-stop</ks> implicitely bring the <em>steprobot</em> to assume a <kc>reactive</kc> behaviour. The <ks>req-stop</ks> 
    implies that the system must be responsive to the <k>stop</k> command. The stop command received is the same that could be received during a step, 
    in fact, as required, when a stop command is received the <em>robot</em> has to stop regardless of the state in which it is. To perform this action 
    the system will send a message to the <em>basicrobot</em>.
